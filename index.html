    <h2>The Impact of Erosion: Nicole's Experience</h2>

    <p>My feet drag behind me as if there were two shackles clamped, suffocating my entire body with the impending weakness that exhaustion brings. After three long days of lugging heavy bags filled with dirt, collecting seeds, and planting mangroves, I was mentally and physically tired. I jolt into consciousness as Mau, our leader helping us with this mangrove reforestation project, starts to speak. “To be realistic, out of the three-hundred and fifty mangroves we planted, only around 50 may survive.” Feeling as if all of our hard work was meaningless, I sigh in defeat. It seemed as if everyone was thinking the same thing as one of my 20 peers spoke up. “So, what was the point in planting so many mangroves if so little were going to survive?” Mau's usual carefree demeanor suddenly turned serious as he stared directly at us. “Because, without trees, we, in La Isla, have nothing.”</p>

    <p>Traveling past a multitude of abandoned houses crumbling into the rapidly growing waters below in the back of Mau’s rusted truck was a rude awakening to the impending dangers that this small town faces. What was once a beautiful biological reserve holding the ruins of stone spheres created by pre-Columbian civilizations and an important breeding ground for endangered species of dolphins and humpback whales, may suddenly disappear into the ever-growing waves, never to be seen again. With two bodies of water surrounding both sides, many are paralyzed with the fear of losing the town they once loved to the never-ending erosion. Wires hanging over roads half-eaten by the water and houses dangling over shorelines provides a terrifying backdrop against the initial image of the perfect beach-side town.</p> 

    <p>Witnessing this small town crumbling beneath the waters below was almost disheartening. Yet, although the erosion has displaced many family homes, the townspeople always find a way to come back to the small town. As the water laps onto their houses, the townspeople simply walk out with a smile on their face and move closer inland. At first, it was hard for me to understand why a person would not just simply move elsewhere. When asking Mau about this, I realized that this town is not just a place where these townsfolk live. This town is the home their ancestors built, and those strong family ties keep them connected to this land filled with the memories created by generations. Although strong, the waters can never keep them away from this land they call home.</p>
    
    <p>The two weeks I spent on La Isla were short, however, I finally learned what serving a community means. Although I did not initially understand why mangrove reforestation projects were worth it, Mau made me realize just how important they are. It is not about how many of the three hundred and fifty mangroves that do not make it, it is about that one percent that does. If those five trees that do survive have the ability to hold a little bit of soil in place, I am content. I never got to see if the mangroves that we planted made it. I might never be able to witness them grow into big mangrove trees with strong roots. Yet, these small seeds we planted with Mau will help to stop the erosion of La Isla little by little. Although I was only a part of this community for a couple of weeks, I will forever carry with me the memories and lessons learned from a small little town held together by the bond of the townsfolk. In that way, I will always be connected to the little community filled with nothing but love.</p>


    <h2>What is Erosion?</h2>
    
    <p>The wearing away of land by forces such as water, wind, and ice is known as erosion. Many interesting features of the Earth's surface, such as mountain peaks, valleys, and coastlines, have been formed as a result of erosion.</p>

    <h2>What Causes Erosion?</h2>

    <p>Erosion is caused by a variety of natural forces. Erosion can happen quickly or slowly, depending on the type of force. Water, wind, and ice are the three main forces that cause erosion.</p>

    <h3>Erosion by Water</h3>

    <p>The primary cause of erosion on Earth is water. Although water may not appear to be a powerful force at first glance, it is one of the most powerful forces on the planet. Water causes erosion in the following ways:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Rainfall - Rainfall can cause erosion both when it falls on the Earth's surface and when raindrops accumulate and flow like small streams.</li>
      <li>Rivers - Rivers can cause significant erosion over time. They break up particles on the riverbed and transport them downstream. The Grand Canyon, which was formed by the Colorado River, is an example of river erosion.</li>
      <li>Ocean waves can cause erosion of the coastline. Because of the shear energy and force of the waves, pieces of rock and coastline break off and change the coastline over time.</li>
      <li>Floods - Large floods, which act like powerful rivers, can cause rapid erosion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Erosion by Wind</h3>

    <p>Wind erosion is a major cause of erosion, particularly in dry areas. Wind can cause erosion by picking up and transporting loose particles and dust (called deflation). When these flying particles collide with the land and break off more particles, it can erode (called abrasion).</p>
    
    <h3>Erosion by Glaciers</h3>

    <p>Glaciers are massive rivers of ice that move slowly, carving out valleys and sculpting mountains. More information about glaciers can be found here.</p>
   
    <h3>Other Forces</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Living Organisms- Small animals, insects, and worms can contribute to erosion by breaking up the soil, making it easier for wind and water to carry away.</li>
      <li>Gravity- Gravity can cause erosion by dragging rocks and other particles down the side of a mountain or cliff. Landslides can be caused by gravity and significantly erode an area.</li>
      <li>Temperature - Temperature changes caused by the Sun heating up a rock can cause it to expand and crack. This can lead to erosion as pieces break off over time.</li>
    </ol>


    <h3>Have Humans Caused Erosion?</h3>

    <p>Human activity has accelerated erosion in many areas. This is accomplished through farming, ranching, logging, and the construction of roads and cities. Each year, human activity causes approximately one million acres of topsoil to erode.</p>

    <h3>Erosion Control</h3>

    <p>Things can be done to reduce the amount of erosion caused by human activity. This includes planting trees around farmland to protect it from the wind, relocating herds so that grasslands can regenerate, and planting new trees to replace those that have been cut down.</p>
